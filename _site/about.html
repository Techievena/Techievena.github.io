## About

The nerdy dude in the group, an artist in his solitude. Yeah you guessed it right! The art you just saw above is one of my creations. A young and ambitious lad from the city of Bhubaneswar, I choose to remain quiet and calm most of the time. Sometimes you can see a lazy sloth sleeping all the day in his uncomfortable bed, procrastinating. Oh, that's me! I rejoice making my mental repository more diverse and informative.

I currently am a Software Developer in the Private Banking and Assets Management team at <a href="https://www.societegenerale.com/en/home" target="blank">Societe Generale</a>. A fresh graduate from the department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering in <a href="http://iitkgp.ac.in/" target="blank">Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</a>. I am a believer in power of open source to change the world and am an active developer for <a href="https://www.apertium.org/" target="blank">Apertium</a>, <a href="http://coala.io/" target="blank">coala</a> and <a href="https://gitmate.io/" target="blank">gitmate</a> organisations. In the past, I have been a mentor for coala organisation in Google Code-in, 2017 edition and student for Apertium organisation in Google Summer of Code, 2018 edition.
