_"The story of life is quicker than the wink of an eye, the story of love is hello and goodbye...until we meet again"_

It's a wrap! Time to do the final clean up of the code and do the submissions. Last four months have been one of the most exciting phase of my life. Did a lot of mistakes; learnt from them..... Got to interact a lot of awesome people..... Wrote thousands of lines of code.... Added a new feature in Apertium I am proud of.... Ohh! There's a long list to speak of.

Tino has created a page for all the Apertiumers listing all their contributions and containing a tarball and a zipfile of the patches. Here is my page: https://apertium.projectjj.com/gsoc2018/techievena. I will be using this page for providing links to my contributions as a part of my final submissions. So I wrote all the details of my work and how to use them in a wiki page of Apertium. Here is it: http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/User:Techievena/GSoC_2018_Work_Product_Submission.
