<p>The dabba or the tiffin as called when it was introduced by the British, is so special to all of us. Going to school and waiting for those long hours in classrooms resisting the smell of your motherâ€™s delicious handcooked sabji and ghee ke parathes waiting inside your dabba to be gulped by you and your friends (if apparently you are spared anything by them). As soon as the tiffin break bell rings, remember your friends jumping on you fighting for your dabba. Those were most rejoiced moments of our school days. The dabba was so special!
