<p>The nerdy dude in the group, an artist in his solitude. Yeah you guessed it right! The masterpiece you just saw above is one of my creations. A young and ambitious lad from the city of Bhubaneswar, I choose to remain quiet and calm most of the time. Sometimes you can see a lazy sloth sleeping all the day in his uncomfortable bed, procrastinating. Oh, thatâ€™s me! I rejoice making my mental repository more diverse and informative.</p>
