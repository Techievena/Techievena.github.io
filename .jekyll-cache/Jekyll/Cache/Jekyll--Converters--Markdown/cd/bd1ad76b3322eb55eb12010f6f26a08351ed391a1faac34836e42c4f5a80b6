<p><em>‚ÄúThe story of life is quicker than the wink of an eye, the story of love is hello and goodbye‚Ä¶until we meet again‚Äù</em>

<p>And‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a wrap! Time to do the final clean up and refactoring of the code and do the submissions. These last four months have been one of the most exciting phase of my life. Did a ton of mistakes; learnt from them. Got an opportunity to interact a lot of wonderful people, wrote thousands of lines of code and added a completely new feature in the Apertium codebase that I am proud of. Oh! That‚Äôs a long list to speak of.</p>

<p>So, now that the Google Summer of Code final phase is about to get over; its time to level up and wait for the new challenges that lay ahead of me, tackle them and rejoice them.</p>

<p>Tino has created a page for all the Apertiumers listing all their contributions and containing a tarball and a zipfile of the patches. Here is my page:</p>

<p>I will be using this page for providing links to my contributions as a part of my final submissions. So I wrote all the details of my work and how to use them in a wiki page of Apertium. Here is it:</p>

<p><strong>Bon adieu!</strong></p>
